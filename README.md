# vscode-debug-test

In `launch.json`, there has two config:

- chrome: use normal debug
- pwa-chrome: use vscode-js-debug

## Problems

When use chrome config to debug, every thing works right, bug when switch to pwa-chrome, there has two problems:

1. lanuch is slow
2. when I set breakpoint, it appear to wrong line
